# Angular Pizza Group Challenge

A group challenge completed during Prime Digital Academy's Full Stack Engineering Coursework.

# Assignment

The objective for this assignment was to build an application that represented the process of ordering a pizza. 

The first view will be the actual order screen. Users can select from Small, Medium, or Large sized pizzas. These each need to have a unique price ( $6, $7, and $8 respectively for example ). Then, a user can add additional toppings. You need to have at least 6 toppings. Each topping will add $1 to the total cost of the pizza. A user may only add one of each topping and certainly only select one size. Finally, there needs to be an ' add pizza ' button that adds the pizza to a factory list so that it may be seen on another Angular Route.

The second view needs to show a list of pizzas that have been added. It will need to show the size of the pizza, its toppings, and the total cost of that pizza. Each listed pizza should have two buttons, one to confirm the pizza, the other to cancel the pizza. Canceled pizzas should be deleted altogether.

The third and final view should have a list of confirmed pizzas, their totals, and then a grand total of confirmed pizzas.
